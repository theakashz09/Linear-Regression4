        "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans = Lasso regression is a regularization technique. It is used over regression methods for a more accurate prediction. This model uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point as the mean. The lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models (i.e. models with fewer parameters). This particular type of regression is well-suited for models showing high levels of multicollinearity or when you want to automate certain parts of model selection, like variable selection/parameter elimination.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lasso Regression uses L1 regularization technique. It is used when we have more features because it automatically performs feature selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how LASSO regression works:\n",
        "\n",
        "###### Linear regression model: LASSO regression starts with the standard linear regression model, which assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target). The linear regression equation can be represented as follows: <br>y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₚxₚ + ε <br> Where:\n",
        "- y is the dependent variable (target).\n",
        "- β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., βₚ are the coefficients (parameters) to be estimated.\n",
        "- x₁, x₂, ..., xₚ are the independent variables (features).\n",
        "- ε represents the error term.\n",
        "###### L1 regularization: LASSO regression introduces an additional penalty term based on the absolute values of the coefficients. The L1 regularization term is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients multiplied by a tuning parameter λ : <br>L₁ = λ * (|β₁| + |β₂| + ... + |βₚ|) <br>Where:\n",
        "- λ is the regularization parameter that controls the amount of regularization applied.\n",
        "- β₁, β₂, ..., βₚ are the coefficients.\n",
        "###### Objective function: The objective of LASSO regression is to find the values of the coefficients that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values, while also minimizing the L1 regularization term: <br>Minimize: RSS + L₁ <br>Where:\n",
        "- RSS is the residual sum of squares, which measures the error between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",
        "###### Shrinking coefficients: By adding the L1 regularization term, LASSO regression can shrink the coefficients towards zero. When λ is sufficiently large, some coefficients are driven to exactly zero. This property of LASSO makes it useful for feature selection, as the variables with zero coefficients are effectively removed from the model.\n",
        "###### Tuning parameter λ: The choice of the regularization parameter λ is crucial in LASSO regression. A larger λ value increases the amount of regularization, leading to more coefficients being pushed towards zero. Conversely, a smaller λ value reduces the regularization effect, allowing more variables to have non-zero coefficients.\n",
        "###### Model fitting: To estimate the coefficients in LASSO regression, an optimization algorithm is used to minimize the objective function. Coordinate Descent is commonly employed, which iteratively updates each coefficient while holding the others fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "LASSO regression offers a powerful framework for both prediction and feature selection, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets where the number of features is large. By striking a balance between simplicity and accuracy, LASSO can provide interpretable models while effectively managing the risk of overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key features and differences of Lasso Regression compared to other regression techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Regularization Term: Lasso Regression adds an L1 regularization term to the OLS objective function. This term is proportional to the absolute values of the coefficients.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Coefficient Shrinkage and Selection: Lasso Regression not only shrinks the coefficient estimates like Ridge Regression but can also force some coefficients to be exactly zero. This leads to explicit feature selection, as variables with zero coefficients are effectively excluded from the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Sparsity Induction:The L1 regularization term induces sparsity by encouraging the model to prioritize fewer variables while reducing the importance of others.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Handling Multicollinearity:Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity (high correlation between predictor variables) by selecting one variable over others with similar predictive power. This is especially useful when you want to identify a subset of important predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Coefficient Interpretation: The coefficients in Lasso Regression that are not exactly zero can still be interpreted in a similar manner to OLS regression. Coefficients that are exactly zero indicate that the corresponding predictor variables are not included in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Feature Selection: One of the main strengths of Lasso Regression is its ability to perform explicit feature selection. It can help identify the most relevant variables for predicting the response variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Choosing Regularization Strength: Lasso Regression involves tuning a hyperparameter (usually denoted as α) that controls the strength of the regularization. Cross-validation techniques can be used to choose the optimal value of α.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Comparison with Ridge Regression: While both Ridge and Lasso Regression introduce regularization, Lasso is more aggressive in shrinking coefficients toward zero, potentially leading to exact zeros. Ridge may shrink coefficients to small but non-zero values.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Elastic Net Combination:Elastic Net Regression is a hybrid of Ridge and Lasso Regression, incorporating both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization terms. It provides a balance between feature selection and coefficient stability\n"

        "\n",
        "Ans = Lasso Regression advantages when it comes to feature selection:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Automatic and Explicit Selection: Lasso performs automatic and explicit feature selection by driving some coefficients to exactly zero. This means that it not only reduces the coefficients' magnitudes but can also exclude irrelevant predictors from the model entirely.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Simplicity: The resulting model is simpler, containing only the most influential predictors. This simplicity aids in model interpretation and understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Reduced Overfitting: Lasso helps prevent overfitting by removing noise variables, resulting in a model that generalizes better to new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Multicollinearity Handling: Lasso effectively handles multicollinearity by choosing one variable from a group of highly correlated variables. This improves the stability of the coefficient estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Sparse Solutions: Lasso induces sparsity in the coefficient estimates, leading to a sparse solution where many coefficients are exactly zero. This is particularly useful when dealing with datasets containing a large number of predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Suitable for High-Dimensional Data: In scenarios where the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations, Lasso excels by identifying the most relevant features while excluding noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Regularization Parameter Tuning: The strength of the regularization can be controlled using the hyperparameter α. Cross-validation can help select the optimal α that balances feature selection and model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Decision-Making: Lasso provides insights into which predictors are most relevant for predicting the response variable. This information can guide decision-making and resource allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Efficiency: A smaller set of predictors translates to a more efficient model in terms of computation, storage, and resource utilization.\n",

        "Ways to interpret the coefficients in Lasso Regression:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Magnitude and Sign: Similar to OLS regression, the sign of a coefficient in Lasso Regression indicates the direction of the relationship between a predictor variable and the response variable. A positive coefficient implies a positive impact on the response, while a negative coefficient implies a negative impact.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Magnitude and Sparsity: One of the key differences in Lasso Regression is that some coefficients may be exactly zero due to the regularization. This means that the corresponding predictors are not contributing to the model at all. The coefficients that are not exactly zero represent the predictors that are considered important by the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Relative Importance: The relative importance of predictors can be gauged by comparing the magnitudes of the non-zero coefficients. Larger magnitudes indicate stronger effects on the response variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Normalization and Scaling: Scaling of predictor variables is important for proper coefficient interpretation. It's recommended to standardize continuous variables (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) before applying Lasso Regression. This ensures that the coefficients are on the same scale and allows for a fair comparison of their magnitudes.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Interaction Terms: If interaction terms are included in the model, the coefficients of these terms represent the change in the response variable associated with a one-unit change in one predictor variable while holding others constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Regularization Parameter (α): The strength of the regularization is controlled by the hyperparameter α. Larger values of α lead to more coefficients becoming exactly zero. The optimal value of α can be chosen using techniques like cross-validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Intercept Term: Remember to include an intercept (constant) term in the model. The intercept represents the expected value of the response variable when all predictor variables are zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Model Complexity: Lasso Regression's coefficient estimates are influenced by both the data and the regularization term. Smaller coefficients reflect both the relationships in the data and the impact of the regularization."

This can help prevent overfitting and improve generalization to new data. However, if α is set too high, the model might underfit and miss important relationships in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Normalization of Predictor Variables:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Lasso Regression is sensitive to the scaling of predictor variables. Standardizing continuous variables (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) is recommended before applying Lasso. This ensures that all variables are on a similar scale, and the regularization term affects them equally.\n",
        "- ***Effect on Performance:*** Standardization improves the stability of the model and ensures that the regularization term treats all variables fairly. It prevents variables with larger scales from dominating the regularization effect.\n",
        "\n",

        "When tuning these parameters, it's common to use techniques like cross-validation to find the values that result in the best model performance on unseen data. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into training and validation subsets multiple times and evaluating the model's performance for different parameter values. The parameter values that lead to the best cross-validation performance are then selected.\n",

For example, if the goal is to achieve feature selection and create a simpler model, higher values of α might be preferred. On the other hand, if maintaining predictive accuracy is crucial, a lower value of α might be more appropriate.\n",
